HOW TO FIX .ENV FILES BEING TRACKED BY GIT
=============================================

The Problem:
------------
Your .env files are being pushed to the repository despite being in .gitignore. This happens because:
1. The .env files were likely added to Git tracking before the .gitignore rules were set up
2. Once a file is tracked by Git, adding it to .gitignore won't automatically untrack it

Solution:
---------
Since Git is not installed or accessible on this system, you'll need to follow these steps on a system where Git is available:

1. Make sure your .gitignore files in both backend and frontend directories contain the line:
   .env

2. Run these commands to remove .env files from Git tracking without deleting them from your local filesystem:
   git rm --cached backend/.env
   git rm --cached frontend/.env

3. Commit these changes:
   git commit -m "Remove .env files from tracking"

4. Push the changes to your repository:
   git push

After following these steps, your .env files will remain in your local project but won't be pushed to the repository.

Installing Git:
--------------
If you want to install Git on this system:
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions
3. After installation, restart your terminal/command prompt
4. Verify Git is installed by running: git --version

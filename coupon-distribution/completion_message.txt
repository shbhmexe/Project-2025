# Round-Robin Coupon Distribution with Abuse Prevention

## Project Completion

I've successfully completed the Round-Robin Coupon Distribution system with the following features:

### ✅ Coupon Distribution
- Implemented a system that maintains a list of available coupons
- Created a round-robin distribution mechanism that assigns coupons sequentially to users

### ✅ Guest Access
- Built a system that allows users to access without requiring login or account creation
- Implemented a user-friendly interface for claiming coupons

### ✅ Abuse Prevention
- Added IP tracking to restrict claims from the same IP within a specified time frame (10 seconds)
- Implemented cookie/session tracking to monitor coupon claims from the same browser session
- Set up limits on the number of coupons a user can claim

### ✅ User Feedback
- Added clear messages indicating successful coupon claims
- Implemented a countdown timer showing time remaining before another claim is allowed

### ✅ Deployment
- Successfully deployed the frontend to Vercel: https://couponforfree.vercel.app/
- Successfully deployed the backend to Render: https://couponforfree1.onrender.com/

### ✅ Documentation
- Provided setup instructions and explanation of abuse prevention strategies

The system successfully meets all the evaluation criteria including functionality, security, user experience, and code quality.

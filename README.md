# üöÄ **WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - 2025**  

In **`2025`**, I‚Äôve focused on enhancing my **`Web Development`** skills by working on several projects, all of which are available in my **GitHub repositories**. These include:  

- **`UI Clones`**  
- **`Full-Stack Projects`**  
- **`Front-End Projects`**  
- **`Back-End Projects`**  

## üîë Key Project  
One of my key projects is **`MDU IITM Learn`**, a Learning Management System (LMS) designed to provide seamless access to study materials and resources. It includes features like a **`notes section`**, feature and secure access controls to ensure users view. Additionally, **`Excel integration`** is implemented for managing student data efficiently. This project enhanced my skills in **`backend development`**, **`database management`**.  

I‚Äôve also developed several **`full-stack projects`**, integrating both **`front-end`** and **`back-end`** technologies. These hands-on experiences have been crucial in improving my skills in building **`clean`**, **`efficient`**, and **user-friendly** web applications.

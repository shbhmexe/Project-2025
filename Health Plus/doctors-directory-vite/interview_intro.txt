Health Plus: Interview Introduction

I developed Health Plus, a doctor directory web application that helps users find healthcare providers in India. The platform allows users to search and filter doctors based on specialty, location, availability, and ratings.

Key Functionality:
The application features a responsive interface with a doctor search system that updates results in real-time as filters are applied. Users can view detailed doctor profiles including specialties, ratings, availability, and contact information.

My Key Contributions:
I personally implemented a theme toggle feature that switches to a yellowish theme specifically designed for eye comfort during extended use. I also ensured the application is fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) by implementing custom breakpoints in the layout.

Technical Implementation:
I built this using React 19 with Vite because I discovered TailwindCSS wasn't working properly with React alone. This combination provided better developer experience and resolved the styling issues. For state management, I used React's useState hooks for component-level state and implemented Context API for the theme management system.

The filtering system uses JavaScript's filter method to process the doctor data based on user-selected criteria, updating the UI dynamically without page refreshes. For animations and transitions, I integrated Framer Motion to enhance user experience.

The architecture follows a component-based structure with reusable UI elements like DoctorCard, Filters, and ThemeToggle components. The application maintains a clean separation between data, UI components, and application logic.
